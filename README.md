University of Richmond Data Analytics Project 3

An overview of the project and its purpose:
Through this project we are hoping to show the correlation between AI technology milestones and six of the big technology companies stock prices and volume. We except as AI technology is utilized and made more public by each of the six companies, we will see spikes in activity reflected by volume and cost for stocks. Using visualization tools will greatly help in our goal to see actual change throughout each stock’s history.

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:
We hope that by visualizing stocks and showing dates in which news broke about AI technology regarding each company we can paint a picture of how each companies’ stocks were affected by AI technology and its public perception.

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project:
AI technology as a whole has been a hotbed for ethical debate. By focusing on the six of the biggest companies in the technology world we eliminated any ethical quandary that may arise from looking at smaller companies or people’s personal usage. An ethical question that may arise from this analysis may be if making money on a potentially predatory technology is ethical as a whole. The use and rate in which AI is being implemented also may be of concern.

References for the data source(s)
For articles on AI we used a mix of google searches and news media outlets to find dates and descriptions of when any of the 6 companies made monetary or public announcements regarding their relationship with AI technology moving forward.
We used AlphaVantage.com for our stock market research and data.
